# StoryArch -  Plot development Application for writers
--

## DESCRIPTION

<p> 
StoryArch is a creative tool aimed at helping writers build their narratives more efficiently. It streamlines the process of structuring a story, enabling users to outline their plots, build characters, and track story progress effortlessly.
The idea was to develop a non-web-based software application in Java to support individual and collaborative plot development for stories. The application is expected to be deployed on laptops and desktops.

<li> Terminal folder - Terminal View</li>
<li> src - <strong> Back end development folder </strong>
</ol>

## SETUP AND INSTALLATION

<strong> Terminal Usage or IDE Based</strong>
<strong> For Backend : </strong>
<ol>
<li> Compile all files using javac *.java or open using an IDE (Preferably Intelli-J)</li>
<li> Run the MainApp.java file using java MainApp</li>
<li> To access the Projects, Storyboard or chapter -> a random ID is assigned, this can be viewed using (the View option).</li>

## FUNCTIONALITIES :

<ol>
<li> Users must register with the application before they can use it;</li> 
<li> Each story has a project associated with it; </li>
<li> A story plot can be developed by an individual or a team of writers</li> 
<li> The free version of the application supports individual writers, with each allowed a maximum of 10 projects</li>
<li> The paid version (via annual subscription) adds support for teams and unlimited projects;</li>
<li> The application should allow users of the free version to upgrade to the paid version at any time;</li>
<li> The paid version should remind users of upcoming subscription deadlines and allow them to renew using an external payment service;</li>
<li> When there is a team of writers, the story has a chief writer who sets up a project in the application for that item and invites the rest of the team to join;</li>
<li> The application should provide graphical and textual interfaces for plot development;</li>
<li> Plots do not have to be developed in a linear fashion;</li>
<li> When there is a team of writers, each writer can work on a different part of the plot simultaneously;</li>
<li> The application should maintain versions of the plot based on commits by writers;</li>
<li> It should be possible for writers to work in ‘offline’ mode when they are not connected to the network;</li>
<li> The application should allow writers to visualise the story in chronological or chapter order;</li>
<li> Writers should have the option of making use of and paying for external illustration services;</li>
<li> The application should generate chapter outlines as text files to be used with other word processing applications;</li>
<li> Writers should be able to submit plots to publishers (who are external to the system) via existing APIs.</li>
</ol>
